## How It Works

1. **Add Habits**  
   Give your habit a name and description (like "Drink water ðŸ’§" or "Stretch for 5 min").

2. **Track Progress**  
   Every day, just tap to check it off. Your progress is saved locally (and online if enabled).

3. **Calendar View**  
   View a simple color-coded calendar to track your consistency.

4. **Motivation Boost (Optional)**  
   After marking a habit complete, you'll see a kind, encouraging quote to keep you going!

5. **Offline Support**  
   No internet? No problem. Your habits and progress are stored on your device.
